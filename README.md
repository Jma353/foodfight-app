## Virtual Environment Setup
Run the following arguments to setup the virtual environment necessary to maintain packages 

```bash 
[sudo] pip install https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/tarball/develop // to update virtualenv
virtualenv venv // to create virtualenv 
```

Once the `venv` is created, you can activate it by running the following: 

```bash 
source venv/bin/activate 
```

Once you have activated `venv`, run the following to install all package requirements

```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
